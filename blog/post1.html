                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>React Hooks revolutionized the way we write React components by allowing us to use state and other React features without writing a class. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the most commonly used hooks and learn how to build powerful applications with them.</p>

                    <h2>What are React Hooks?</h2>
                    <p>Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. They were introduced in React 16.8 and have since become the preferred way to write React components.</p>

                    <h2>useState Hook</h2>
                    <p>The <strong>useState</strong> hook allows you to add state to functional components. Here's a simple example:</p>

                    <h2>useEffect Hook</h2>
                    <p>The <strong>useEffect</strong> hook lets you perform side effects in function components. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React classes.</p>

                    <h2>Custom Hooks</h2>
                    <p>One of the most powerful features of Hooks is the ability to create your own custom hooks. This allows you to extract component logic into reusable functions.</p>

                    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Only call hooks at the top level</li>
                        <li>Only call hooks from React functions</li>
                        <li>Use the ESLint plugin for hooks</li>
                        <li>Keep hooks simple and focused</li>
                        <li>Extract complex logic into custom hooks</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>React Hooks provide a more direct API to the React concepts you already know. They enable you to write cleaner, more maintainable code while leveraging the full power of React.</p>
